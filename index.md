The code extracts important sentences from a document by calculating word frequencies and scoring sentences based on their relevance. 

## Steps involved include:

* Text Preprocessing – Tokenizing sentences and words, removing stopwords, and handling punctuation.
* Sentence Scoring – Assigning importance scores to sentences based on term frequency.
* Summarization – Extracting the most relevant sentences to form a summary.
